# Governance-Risk-and-Compliance-

Step 1: Measure and Set Goals
Answer the following questions:
Using outside research, indicate the potential security risks of allowing employees to access work information on their personal devices. Identify at least three potential attacks that can be carried out.
 The problem with allowing employees to use personal devices to access work information is that it opens the door to all types of potential security breaches since personal devices are not set up adequately to protect information. Some possible attacks that BYOD could lead to are : 
1.Data Theft , if a personal account on the device is hacked it could lead to access to important work information 
2. Physical theft, if a personal device used to access work information is lost or stolen the party that ends up with the device could get access to private work information. 
3.Malware, an employee could download an infected file infected by malware and this malware could get passed off to the work network next time the employee logs on.

Based on the above scenario, what is the preferred employee behavior?
The preferred employee behavior to mitigate these risks is for the employer to 
1.To limit data theft the employer should launch BYOD software that would allow IT access to managed devices in order to spot suspicious activity and / or monitor application activity on devices connected to the network.
2. To protect against Physical Theft the company should launch MDM ( Mobile Device Management ) protocols that will allow data to be remotely wiped in case of theft to protect against data theft.
3. To protect against possible malware infection the employer should implement a clear strict acceptable usage policy that will greatly deter unsafe practices that may lead to cyber attack vulnerabilities.

What methods would you use to measure how often employees are currently not behaving according to the preferred behavior?
Frequently review ( Weekly ) BYOD software and look out for suspicious activity and application activity and ensure re training if employees are caught misusing access and discipline accordingly ( ex: write up , warnings etc )
Ensure all staff have implemented MDM protocols and are not bypassing them on a weekly basis. ( IT is able to monitor if any devices are bypassed or if MDM protocols are attempted to be bypassed )  If caught bypassing then they should be re trained and discipline accordingly.  ( ex: write up , warnings etc )
 Train all staff on the company's “Acceptable Use Policy” and through weekly monitoring discipline any employees not abiding by the policy and re-train.


What is the goal that you would like the organization to reach regarding this behavior?

The goal that would wish to be achieved by implementing these protocols would be for less than 5% of employees to contribute to compromised data through their own devices. By setting up and implementing this plan we should drastically cut down on Malware infections, Breaches in network security and data loss due to physical theft of devices by immediately remotely wiping lost devices.

Step 2: Involve the Right People
Now that you have a goal in mind, who needs to be involved?
CEO - The Ceo should always be involved in any new protocols being introduced in a company. The CEO can ensure the Security team is implementing the protocols in a manner that will make a positive difference and direct the team on improved adjustments.
COO - The COO should be involved to monitor business functionality. The COO can ensure that the protocols being implemented are not affecting the day to day business of the company.
CISO - The CISO should be involved as it is his job to manage risk. The CISO can ensure that while implementing these protocols that nothing is being overlooked and that they are actually being implemented in a beneficial way to decrease risk posed by these threat actors.
CIO - The CIO should be involved in the development of these systems / protocols. The CIO should be directing the IT team to ensure these protocols are being launched according to best practices and ensuring that IT’s strategies are supporting the company wide goal of ensuring the risk from these threat actors are decreased.
SOC Manager - The SOC manager should be involved to direct SOC operations and ensure clear direction. The SOC manager will act as a bridge between the security analysts and security engineers to ensure both are on the same page to ensure clear Hiring and Training policies and creating and executing on cyber security strategy.

Step 3: Training Plan
Training is part of any security culture framework plan. How will you train your employees on this security concern? In one page, indicate the following:
Training Plan :
	All staff should be trained in person at hiring on what risks BYOD protocols bring to the table and what company protocols are in place to mitigate these risks. They will then be required to take a quarterly refresher online to ensure safe practices are fresh in their mind and not being overlooked. If they fail the online refresher they will be directed to participate in the next in person training.
During this training all new and existing employees will be trained on the following:
1.What BYOD is and what risks are posed with it 
 What potential risks are exposed by using your own device, what the        consequences of misuse and breaches could be and what we can do to decrease risk
2.What the top 3 risks we are trying to mitigate are in these protocols 
Data Theft, Physical Theft & Malware
3.What steps we have taken as a company to mitigate these risks and how they are being implemented
The company is implementing BYOD software. This will allow IT to monitor devices for suspicious activity and / or monitor application use to ensure all devices attached to the network are following safe practices and company protocol
The company is implementing MDM ( mobile device management ) Protocols to protect against data theft. MDM will allow IT to remotely wipe and lost or stolen devices to secure them against sensitive data leaks
The company is implementing a strict “Acceptable Use Policy”. This policy ensures that all employees are aware of the possible risks that could leak to malware infection through Phishing attempts or unauthorized application downloads / installation. By understanding these risks and implementing a strict acceptable usage policy we can ensure that the employees are educated and aware of what is allowed in the company and what is not. They will also be informed that by not abiding by this acceptable use policy strict disciplinary measures will be taken starting with write-ups and possible termination if the employee repeatedly ignores / breaches this policy.
Measuring Effectiveness:
	The SOC Manager and IT team should be monitoring all the above protocols on a weekly basis to ensure that all protocols are being followed and not breached. The measure of effectiveness should be based on 5% or less of employees being caught opening the door to suspicious activity on their devices and by ensuring that all employees are running their MDM software effectively and not trying to bypass it or not running it at all. Also for the data theft protocol they should measure success by ensuring no data breaches are led to by the loss of devices by ensuring all employees are immediately reporting lost or stolen devices.

This portion will require additional outside research on the topic so that you can lay out a clear and thorough training agenda.
Bonus: Other Solutions
Training alone often isn't the entire solution to a security concern.
Indicate at least two other potential solutions. For each one, indicate the following:

Ensuring Encryption on devices

What type of control is it? Technical
What goal does this control have? Encryption is a preventative control

What is one advantage of each solution? No one can access encrypted information without the decryption key

What is one disadvantage of each solution? If the decryption key is lost or forgotten you will not be able to access the data. Also consumes resources


Identity and Access Management

What type of control is it? Administrative
What goal does this control have? Preventative

What is one advantage of each solution? The advantage to IAM solutions is that IT is able to ensure that each employee only has access to the relevant data / tools pertaining to their job
What is one disadvantage of each solution? Improper management of Network, Application and Data access
